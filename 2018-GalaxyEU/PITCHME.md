### A Brief History

<div class="left small center">

<ul>
  <li> Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is commonly known as the *Father of Microbiology* </li>

  <li> In 1676, he discovered **animalcules** when he turned his microscope to a drop of rain water </li>

Note:
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was Dutch scientist, best known for his work in microscopy 

In 1676 he turned his microscope at a drop of rain water and was surprised to find 
what looked like tiny animals, which he called **animalcules**

### Why study the microbiome?

Your microbiome has:

- > 10 times more cells than you
- > 100 times more genes than you
- > 1000 different species


Microbiome is sometimes referred to as your *second genome*

### Why study the microbiome?

**Dysbiosis**: microbial imbalance in the body

- obesity, diabetes
- asthma, allergies
- Crohn's disease, Ulcerative colitis
- Cancer, IBS, Autism

### Approaches

- Amplicon sequencing 
   - targetted
   - e.g. 16S rRNA gene
- Shotgun sequencing 
   - sequence everything


---

### Shotgun Sequencing

- Sequence everything
- Expensive
- Higher complexity

---

### Amplicon Sequencing

- Targetted approach (e.g. 16S/18S rRNA gene)
- Amplifies bacteria, not host or environmental fungi, plants

### Amplicon Sequencing

- Highly conserved regions: easy to target across all bacteria
- Variable regions: distinguish between different types of bacteria
