### A Brief History

<div class="left small center">

<ul>
  <li> Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is commonly known as the *Father of Microbiology* </li>

![scale-30](2018-GalaxyEU/images/leeuwenhoek.jpg)

  <li> In 1676, he discovered **animalcules** when he turned his microscope to a drop of rain water </li>
</ul>

</div>

Note:
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was Dutch scientist, best known for his work in microscopy 

In 1676 he turned his microscope at a drop of rain water and was surprised to find 
what looked like tiny animals, which he called **animalcules**

### Why study the microbiome?

---


<div class="block">
<div class="left small middle">

Your microbiome has:
<ul>
  <li> > 10 times more cells than you </li>
  <li> > 100 times more genes than you </li>
  <li> > 1000 different species </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="right">

Sometimes referred to as your *second genome*

### Dysbiosis

- Microbial imbalance in the body
- Linked to a large number of disease phenotypes
  - Obesity, Diabetes
  - Asthma, Allergies
  - Crohn's disease, Ulcerative colitis
  - Cancer, IBS, Autism

### Approaches

- Amplicon sequencing 
- Shotgun sequencing 

---

### Shotgun Sequencing

<div class="left">
<ul>
<li> Sequence everything </li>
<li> Expensive </li>
<li> Higher complexity </li>
</ul>
</div>

### Amplicon Sequencing

- Targetted approach (e.g. 16S/18S rRNA gene)
- Amplifies bacteria, not host or environmental fungi, plants

--- 

### 16S rRNA gene

- Highly conserved regions 
  - easy to target across all bacteria
- Variable regions 
  - distinguish between different types of bacteria

Note:
around 1500 nucleotides long

### Chimera removal


- Greek mythology: hybrid animals
- Sequencing data: hybrid sequences created during PCR
